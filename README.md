# PECAN: Persistent Condensation

This repository contains our work-in-progress code for
a persistence-enhanced variant of the [diffusion condensation
algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9006013).

## Installing the package

The recommended way of installing the package entails using
[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python. After cloning this
repository, everything can be set up using the following command, with
`$` indicating that the command is to be executed in your terminal:

```
$ poetry install 
```

## Using the package

The simplest way of using the package uses a shell spawned by `poetry`:

```
$ poetry shell
```

You should now be able to call the main scripts of the package.

## Running the algorithm
